# Walmart-Financial-Statement-Analysis

### Introduction 

Walmart Financial Statement Analysis is a comprehensive examination of the financial performance of one of the world's leading retail corporations. Through meticulous analysis of Walmart's financial statements, including the balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, I aim to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into the company's overall financial health.

## What Is Financial Statement Analysis?
Financial statement analysis is the process of analyzing a company’s financial statements for decision-making purposes. 
* External stakeholders use it to understand the overall health of an organization and to evaluate financial performance and business value. 
* Internal constituents use it as a monitoring tool for managing the finances.

## Types of Financial Statements
Companies use the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement to manage the operations of their business and to provide transparency to their stakeholders. All three statements are interconnected and create different views of a company’s activities and performance.

1. Balance Sheet

The balance sheet is a report of a company’s financial worth in terms of book value. It is broken into three parts to include a company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity. Short-term assets such as cash and accounts receivable can tell a lot about a company’s operational efficiency; liabilities include the company’s expense arrangements and the debt capital it is paying off; and shareholder equity includes details on equity capital investments and retained earnings from periodic net income.  

The balance sheet shows your debt coverage and asset liquidity in real time. The difference between assets and liabilities gives you the 'owner's equity.' This figure is considered a company’s book value and serves as an important performance metric that increases or decreases with the financial activities of a company.

2. Income Statement

The income statement breaks down the revenue that a company earns against the expenses involved in its business to provide a bottom line, meaning the net profit or loss. The income statement is broken into three parts that help to analyze business efficiency at three different points. It begins with revenue and the direct costs associated with revenue to identify gross profit. It then moves to operating profit, which subtracts indirect expenses like marketing costs, general costs, and depreciation. Finally, after deducting interest and taxes, the net income is reached.

Basic analysis of the income statement usually involves the calculation of gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin, which each divide profit by revenue. Profit margin helps to show where company costs are low or high at different points of the operations.

A summary of this does two things. First, it shows you gaps in increasing operating profit by allowing you to boost sales revenue, reduce cost, or both. It's also an income statement showing how effective your strategies are at the start of your financial year.

3. Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement provides an overview of the company’s cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net income is carried over to the cash flow statement, where it is included as the top line item for operating activities. Like its title, investing activities include cash flows involved with firm-wide investments. The financing activities section includes cash flow from both debt and equity financing. The bottom line shows how much cash a company has available.

Potential investors look at your cash flow statement summary for two reasons. One, it lets them see if you make enough money to settle your debts. Two, it helps them decide whether your company is worth investing in.

### Tools Used:

1. Python for Web Scraping and Analysis of Financial Statements.
2. Excel for Data Understanding and Storing Data in .XLSX and .CSV Formats.
3. Tableau for building Dashboard.

### Work Process

In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of Walmart's Financial Statements by leveraging Web Scraping and data analysis using Python. Initially, I utilized Python libraries to extract the required financial data from a reliable Stock Analysis website. This enabled me to acquire the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement of Walmart. With these financial statements at hand, I employed Python for in-depth analysis, unraveling key insights into Walmart's financial performance.

To enhance the interpretability and presentation of the findings, I used visualization capabilities of Tableau. Through insightful data visualizations, I aimed to predict and highlight noteworthy observations, patterns, and trends within the financial data. Furthermore, based on the analysis, I formulated well-informed recommendations to optimize Walmart's financial strategies and performance.

#### Top 7 key observations made are as mentioned below:

1. Over the past five years, Walmart has encountered significant fluctuations in its working capital per dollar of sales. In 2022, the lowest point was reached, amounting to -$16k, while the highest point of -$2k was observed in 2020. These figures emphasize the importance of vigilant monitoring and management of working capital efficiency to ensure optimal financial health. 
2. The equity to debt ratio for Walmart has shown an increasing trend, rising from 1.8 in 2021 to 2.3 in 2022. This suggests that the company is taking on more debt, which could be a sign of financial trouble.
3. While Walmart witnessed a modest 0.6% improvement in inventory turnover from 2021 to 2022, it remains comparably lower than historical levels. This underscores the significance of optimizing our inventory management strategies to unlock operational efficiencies and to reduce unnecessary holding costs to stop the drainage on cash flow.
4. The current and net profit ratios for Walmart have experienced a decline over the past three years. This suggests that the company is not generating enough profit to cover its expenses, which indicates the importance of analyzing and addressing factors impacting profitability to ensure sustainable financial performance.
5. Walmart has observed a downward trajectory in its operating gross margin and gross profit margins over the past five years. This suggests that the company is facing increasing competition or that its costs are rising. This signals the need to review cost structures, pricing strategies, and operational efficiencies to maintain or improve profitability.
6. Although the Asset Turnover has increased, but the Return on Assets (ROA) has been declining over the past five years. This suggests that the company is not using its assets effectively to generate profits, while the company is generating higher sales relative to its assets, the returns on those assets have not been maximizing their potential. Evaluating asset utilization and implementing strategies to improve ROA will be crucial.
7. The Price to Cash Flow Ratio for Walmart has declined from 31.18 in 2021 to 26.77 in 2022. This indicates a relatively lower valuation placed on the company's cash flows by the market. It may be worthwhile to explore factors influencing this decline and evaluate the company's cash flow generation and utilization. This suggests that investors are becoming less confident in the company's future prospects.

#### Recommendations to Improve Financial Performance:

1. Working Capital Management: Implement rigorous working capital management practices to optimize cash flow. This includes monitoring inventory levels, streamlining accounts receivable and payable processes, and negotiating favorable terms with suppliers. By proactively managing working capital, we can enhance liquidity and reduce the negative working capital per dollar of sales observed in recent years.
2. Profitability Enhancement: Conduct a comprehensive review of cost structures and identify opportunities for cost optimization. Implement efficiency measures to control operating expenses without compromising quality and customer experience. Additionally, explore revenue growth strategies, such as product diversification, market expansion, and targeted marketing campaigns, to drive top-line growth and improve profit margins.
3. Inventory Management: Enhance inventory turnover by adopting advanced inventory management techniques, such as just-in-time (JIT) inventory, demand forecasting, and efficient supply chain management. This will help avoid excessive inventory levels, reduce carrying costs, and improve cash flow efficiency.
4. Cash Flow Generation: Focus on generating robust cash flows by optimizing working capital, improving operational efficiency, and monitoring expenses. Strengthen cash flow generation by exploring alternative revenue streams, such as strategic partnerships, licensing agreements, or innovative business models, to diversify income sources and reduce dependency on traditional revenue streams.
5. Return on Assets (ROA) Improvement: Evaluate asset utilization and identify underperforming assets or areas where efficiency can be improved. Implement measures to enhance asset productivity through process automation, technology adoption, and employee training. Additionally, consider divesting non-performing assets and reallocating resources to high-growth and high-return opportunities.
6. Investor Communication: Enhance transparency and effectively communicate the company's growth strategy, financial performance, and cash flow management to investors and stakeholders. Regularly engage with investors through earnings calls, investor presentations, and timely financial reporting to address concerns and build confidence in the company's long-term prospects.
