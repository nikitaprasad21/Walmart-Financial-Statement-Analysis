### Introduction 

## What Is Financial Statement Analysis?
Financial statement analysis is the process of analyzing a company’s financial statements for decision-making purposes. 
* External stakeholders use it to understand the overall health of an organization and to evaluate financial performance and business value. 
* Internal constituents use it as a monitoring tool for managing the finances.

## Types of Financial Statements
Companies use the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement to manage the operations of their business and to provide transparency to their stakeholders. All three statements are interconnected and create different views of a company’s activities and performance.

1. Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is a report of a company’s financial worth in terms of book value. It is broken into three parts to include a company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity. Short-term assets such as cash and accounts receivable can tell a lot about a company’s operational efficiency; liabilities include the company’s expense arrangements and the debt capital it is paying off; and shareholder equity includes details on equity capital investments and retained earnings from periodic net income.  

The balance sheet shows your debt coverage and asset liquidity in real time. The difference between assets and liabilities gives you the 'owner's equity.' This figure is considered a company’s book value and serves as an important performance metric that increases or decreases with the financial activities of a company.

2. Income Statement
The income statement breaks down the revenue that a company earns against the expenses involved in its business to provide a bottom line, meaning the net profit or loss. The income statement is broken into three parts that help to analyze business efficiency at three different points. It begins with revenue and the direct costs associated with revenue to identify gross profit. It then moves to operating profit, which subtracts indirect expenses like marketing costs, general costs, and depreciation. Finally, after deducting interest and taxes, the net income is reached.

Basic analysis of the income statement usually involves the calculation of gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin, which each divide profit by revenue. Profit margin helps to show where company costs are low or high at different points of the operations.

A summary of this does two things. First, it shows you gaps in increasing operating profit by allowing you to boost sales revenue, reduce cost, or both. It's also an income statement showing how effective your strategies are at the start of your financial year.

3. Cash Flow Statement
The cash flow statement provides an overview of the company’s cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net income is carried over to the cash flow statement, where it is included as the top line item for operating activities. Like its title, investing activities include cash flows involved with firm-wide investments. The financing activities section includes cash flow from both debt and equity financing. The bottom line shows how much cash a company has available.

Potential investors look at your cash flow statement summary for two reasons. One, it lets them see if you make enough money to settle your debts. Two, it helps them decide whether your company is worth investing in.
